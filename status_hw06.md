Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What are the names of the members of your team?

Hartley (Jim) Howe

James Kuesel


2. What hostname did you deploy to?

hw06.jim-howe.com


3. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?

We were unable to get the timer functionality working, so opted for another method of regulating user guesses.


4. What part of your application state is on the server?

Our entire application state is on the server, except for the current users name.
This state inclused the secret, the list of players/observers, the list of players who are ready,
the list of all guesses, the current guess of each user, the win/loss counts of users, a bool
to tell if the game has started, and the view.


5. What part of your application state, if any, is in the browser?

Only the users name from our application state is processed in the browser.

The browser also has other pieces of state used for the display like the list of players
and observers, the view, whether the game has started, and the win/loss counts.
Definitely not the secret!!
