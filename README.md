NOTE TO GRADERS:


All functionality is complete. Instead of a 30 second timer to make guesses, we opted to give users unlimited
time and to process the guesses once all users have made them. The game begins when all users who have selected
"player" also select "ready". Those who did not select ready are stuck as observer until the game is reset.

Another design choice we made was to use two buttons for ready and not ready instead of a checkbox, as it looked
more visually appealing and has the exact same functinality.

When an invalid guess is made the user receives a 'bad guess' alert and must re-enter their guess.
